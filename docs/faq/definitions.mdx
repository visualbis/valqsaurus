| Value Driver Tree | Mathematical or conceptual business models visualised in a way that links the business KPI’s (what management or stakeholders care about) to the operational drivers (the things that can be influenced to change the KPI’s). |
| Node              | A generic reference to a unique KPI or Value Driver in a value driver tree                                                                                                                                                    |
| Node Widget       | The visualization of a KPI or Value Driver in a value driver tree                                                                                                                                                             |
| Derived Node      | Additional Information for a node but not directly related to the calculation hierarchy. This will often be key benchmarking KPI’s such as cost/production unit.                                                              |
| Parent            | A reference to the Node one level above in the Value Driver Tree                                                                                                                                                              |
| Children          | A reference to the collection of nodes immediately below a Node                                                                                                                                                               |
