  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Now let's take a look at the features of the Plan tab

## 1. View Current Series

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You can see the name of the series you are currently working on the top panel as highlighted below.
</div> <br /> 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan5.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
On clicking the settings icon, the newly created series can be set as primary or comparison series for the Plan tab. You can also 
rename or delete the series here.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan5.2.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

> **Note** <br />
Set as Primary/Comparison sets the series as Primary/Comparison series across all the tabs on ValQ 

## 2. Add New Series

Click the '+ New Series' to add another series to the Plan tab.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan18.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

## 3. Action Menu 

In the 'Action Menu’, you will find various options to configure the Plan tab

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan19.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.1 Weight

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Node's total value can be changed - manually or by simply, adding or subtracting to get a new total value.
Weight distributes a node's new total value among the periods based on the series and the node selected by the user.
You have two ways to distribute a node's total value - Overwrite Values or Append to Values. 
</div> <br />

**Total Value:** The node's value under the Total column

**Period Value:** The node values under the period (month) columns

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan7.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Let's understand Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values and Append to Values using illustrations:

**Example 1: Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values**

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series 2', 'Overall Result' is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are child nodes.
Overall Result's Calculation Method is the sum of its children. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Here 'East' node's total is changed from 260 to 600 and the weight is applied based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series
'New Series 2'. Change action is selected as Overwrite Values.  
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/weight ow.png')}
    width={675}
    height={585}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total of 600 is distributed as period values based on the spread of the 'Midwest' node.
The existing values of the 'East' node have been overwritten by the new values. The parent node 'Overall Result' also gets changed as the result of this action. 
</div> <br />

**Example 2: Spread by Weights with Append to Values**

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series 2', 'Overall Result' is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are child nodes.
Overall Result's Calculation Method is the sum of its children. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Here 'East' node's total is changed from 260 to 600 and the weight is applied based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series
'New Series 2'. Change action is selected as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/weight ap.png')}
    width={675}
    height={585}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total is 600 and the difference between the original total and the new total is 340 (600-260).
Based on the spread of the 'Midwest' node, the difference of 340 is distributed by way of addition to the existing period values. 
The parent node 'Overall Result' also gets changed as the result of this action.
</div>

### 3.2 Equals

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Like Weight, here you can edit the original total value - manually or by simply, adding or subtracting to get new total value.
Equal distributes a node's new total value equally over the periods. With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan8.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

**Example 3: Equal with Overwrite Values**

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 260 to 600 and Change action is selected as Overwrite Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/equals ow.png')}
    width={675}
    height={440}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

As you can observe, the new total value of 600 is distributed equally to all the period values. The existing values of the 'East' have been overwritten by the new values.

**Example 4: Equal with Append to Values**

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 260 to 600 and Change action is selected as Append to Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/equals ap.png')}
    width={675}
    height={440}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the new total value is 600 and the difference between the original total and the new total is 340 (600-260).
The difference of 340 is now distributed by way of addition to the existing period values.
</div>

### 3.3 Trend

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Trend enables the user to increase/decrease the existing period values of a node - By Percentage or By Value.
With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan9.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

**Example 5: Increase Trend By Percentage with Overwrite Values**

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is changed from 10 to 50. The Trend is selected as an increase by 2% and Change action
is selected as Overwrite Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/trend ow.png')}
    width={675}
    height={460}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 50 and the remaining period values are incremented by 2% of 50. 
The existing values of the node 'East' have been overwritten by the new values.
</div> <br />

**Example 6: Increase Trend By Value with Append to Values**

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is kept as 10. The Trend is selected as an increase by value of 12 and 
Change action is selected as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/trend ap.png')}
    width={675}
    height={460}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 10 and the remaining
period values are incremented by 12 in addition to the existing period values.
</div> <br />

> **Note**
The Increase Trend option accepts both positive and negative values.

### 3.4 Copy-to

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Copy-to option takes a node's period value and applies the same value to the remaining periods of that node.
The change gets updated to the parent node as well and is highlighted in yellow as seen below.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan10.png')} />

  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.6 Allocate Children

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Child nodes are allocated either by 'Weight' or 'Equal' under this 
option and 'Copy-to' is used to copy a node's value to its sibling nodes.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.10 View Allocation History

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
View Allocation History is used to view the changes performed and also roll back changes when needed.
'Reset all' would delete all the allocation adjustments made to the series. 'Restore to this
step' traces back to the selected step.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan16.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.11 Show hidden nodes

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You have an option to display the nodes that were hidden while building the model under the Model tab.
Here, East is the hidden node and on selecting the Show hidden node option, it gets displayed.
However, notice that the Overall Result doesn't get affected. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan27.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

> ** Note** <br /> Upon enabling show hidden node, the node stays hidden on the other tabs.

## 4. Search for a Node

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You can take a look at a particular node and it's children by entering the node name or ID  using the search bar. 
The model along with period values get displayed in a table form. In case, the empty series has been chosen as the series
