<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The Plan tab consists of an Action Menu bar with various options to help
  create a plan and a table with the ValQ model in a hierarchical format along
  with the period values for each node.
</div> <br />

Now let's take a look at the contents of the Plan tab in detail.

## 1. View existing series

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  You can see the name of the series you are currently working with on the top.
</div> <br />{" "}

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan5.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  On clicking the settings icon next to the series name, the current series can
  be set as primary or comparison series across all the tabs on ValQ. You can
  also rename or delete the series here.
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="New Series" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan5.2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

## 2. Add New Series

Click the + New Series to add another series to the Plan tab.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan18.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

## 3. Action Menu

In the Action Menu, you will find various options to configure your planning data

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Action Menu" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan19.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  These operations are explained in detail with illustrations.
</div> <br />

1. [Weight](#31-weight) - Allocate node values with weights from another node
1. [Equals](#32-equals) - Allocate node values equally
1. [Trend](#33-trend) - Apply trend to node period values
1. [Copy-to](#34-copy-to) - Copy a period value to all other periods of the node
1. [Auto Forecast](#35-auto-forecast) - Perform time series forecasting
1. [Allocate Children](#36-allocate-children) - Allocate values to a node's children
1. [Hold and Release](#37-hold-and-release) - Hold and Release cells on Plan tab
1. [Note](#38-note) - Add comments to a cell
1. [Refresh Datasource](#39-refresh-datasource) - Refresh the source data on the _Plan_ tab
1. [View Allocation History](#310-view-allocation-history) - View all the changes made in the _Plan_ tab
1. [Show Hidden Nodes](#311-show-hidden-nodes) - Display the nodes kept as hidden

Before we explain the options, there are a few key points you must know to understand the Plan tab operations better.

1. Weight and Equals are available only for total values
2. Trend and Copy-to are available only for period values
3. ValQ provides two methods of distribution - Overwrite Values and Append to Values
4. Overwrite Values replaces the existing values with the new values
5. Append to Values retains the existing values and adds/subtracts the change to the same

### 3.1 Weight

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Weight distributes a node's total value among the periods based on the series
  and the node selected by the user. The total value can be changed by editing
  the value inside the box indicated by the arrow, you can choose a different
  node from the same series or a node from another series.
</div> <br />

With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan7.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Let's understand Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values and Append to Values using illustrations:

### Example 1: Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series', 'Overall Result'
  is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are child nodes. Overall Result's
  Calculation Method is the sum of its children.
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Here 'East' node's total is changed from 30 to 120 and the weight is applied
  based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series 'New Series'. Change
  action is selected as Overwrite Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img
      height="500"
      alt="Spread by Weight"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/weight ow.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total of 120 is distributed
  as period values based on the spread of the 'Midwest' node. The new values of
  'East' node take the place of the existing values. The parent node 'Overall
  Result' also gets changed as a result of this action.
</div>{" "}

### Example 2: Spread by Weights with Append to Values

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series', 'Overall Result'
  is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are child nodes. Overall Result's
  Calculation Method is the sum of its children.
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Here 'East' node's total is changed from 30 to 120 and the weight is applied
  based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series 'New Series'. Change
  action is selected as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img
      height="500"
      alt="Spread by weight with append to values"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/weight ap.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total is 120 and the
  difference between the original total and the new total is 90 (120-30). Based
  on the spread of the 'Midwest' node, the difference of 90 is distributed by
  way of addition to the existing period values. The parent node 'Overall
  Result' also gets changed as a result of this action.
</div>

### 3.2 Equals

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Equals distribute a node's new total value equally over the periods. With the
  Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to
  Values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan8.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Let's understand Equal with Overwrite Values and Append to Values using illustrations:

### Example 3: Equal with Overwrite Values

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 60 to 90 and Change action is selected as Overwrite Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Equal wit Overwrite values"
      height="400"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/equals ow.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe, the new total value of 90 is distributed equally to all
  the period values. The new values of the 'East' take the place of the existing
  values.
</div>

### Example 4: Equal with Append to Values

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 60 to 90 and Change action is selected as Append to Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Equal with Append to Values"
      height="400"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/equals ap.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe, the new total value is 90 and the difference between the
  original total and the new total is 30 (90-60). The difference of 30 is now
  distributed by way of addition to the existing period values.
</div>

### 3.3 Trend

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Trend enables the user to increase/decrease the existing period values of a
  node - By Percentage or By Value. With the Change action option, the user can
  choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan9.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 5: Increase Trend By Percentage with Overwrite Values

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is 1000. The
  Trend is selected as an increase of 10% and Change action is chosen as
  Overwrite Values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Increase Trend"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/trend ow.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 1000 and the remaining
  period values are incremented by 10% of the previous period value. The new
  values of the 'East' take the place of the existing values.
</div>

### Example 6: Increase Trend By Value with Append to Values

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is 1000. The
  Trend is selected as an increase by the value of 100 and Change action is
  chosen as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Increase Trend By Value with Append to Values"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/trend ap.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 1000 and the remaining
  period values are incremented by 100 in addition to the existing period
  values.
</div> <br />

> **Note** <br />
> The Increase Trend option accepts both positive and negative values

### 3.4 Copy-to

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Copy-to option takes a node's period value and applies the same value to the
  remaining periods of that node. The change gets updated to the parent node as
  well and is highlighted in yellow as seen below.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan10.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 7: Copy-to

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node has been copied
  to all the other period values of the node 'East' using the option Copy-to.
  The new values of the 'East' take the place of the existing values and then
  ValQ re-calculates the total as a sum of its period values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Apply Copy-to property"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan10.1.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.5 Auto Forecast

Auto Forecast enables the user to apply Time Series Forecasting methods to the plan. This option is covered in a separate section,
click <Link to={useBaseUrl('planning/time_series')}>here</Link> to know more about it.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Auto Forecast" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan11.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.6 Allocate Children

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  So far we have covered the options that perform allocation horizontally.
  Weight and Equal options under Allocate Children are used to allocate values
  to the children and Copy-to is used to copy a node's value to its sibling
  nodes.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Allocate Children" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan12.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.7 Hold and Release

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Hold and Release can be used to lock or unlock cells as needed. The feature
  can be applied on cell, period, row or column level. The cells kept on hold
  does not get affected by any of the allocation methods.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan13.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.8 Note

The Note helps the user to add, modify, or delete comments to the model on cell level.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan14.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.9 Refresh Datasource

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Refresh Datasource can be used in case of any changes to the input data. On
  clicking Refresh Datasource, the plan gets updated and the allocation
  performed on the plan gets re-applied on the recent data.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Refresh Datasource" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan15.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.10 View Allocation History

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  View Allocation History is used to view the changes performed and also to roll
  back changes when needed. Reset all deletes all the allocation adjustments
  made to the series and Restore to this step can be used to get to any point in
  the Allocation History.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan16.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.11 Show hidden nodes

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  You have an option to display the nodes that were hidden while building the
  model under the Model tab. Here, East is the hidden node and on selecting the
  Show hidden node option, it gets displayed. However, notice that the Overall
  Result doesn't get affected.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan27.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

> ** Note** <br /> Upon enabling show hidden node, the node stays hidden on the other tabs

## 4. Search for a node

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  You can take a look at a particular node and it's children by entering the
  node name or ID using the search bar. The model along with period values get
  displayed in a table form. In case, the empty series has been chosen as the
  series to start with, only the structure and relationships are displayed and
  not the values.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/plan6.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

## 5. View node configuration
