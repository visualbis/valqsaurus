</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
These operations are explained in detail with illustrations. Click on an option from the following table to know more.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}} className="table-center">

|   | Options         | Description                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
|---|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Weight](#31-weight)     | Allocate node values with weights from another node                     |
| 2 | [Equals](#32-equals)     | Allocate node values equally                    |
| 3 | [Trend](#33-trend)      | Apply trend to node period values  |

| 11| [Show Hidden Nodes](#311-show-hidden-nodes) | Display the nodes kept as hidden |  

</div> <br />

Before we explain the options, there are a few key points you must know to understand the Plan tab operations better.

1. Weight and Equals are available only for total values 
2. Trend and Copy-to are available only for period values
3. ValQ provides two methods of distribution - Overwrite Values and Append to Values
4. Overwrite Values replaces the existing values with the new values
5. Append to Values retains the existing values and adds/subtracts the change to the same

### 3.1 Weight

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Weight distributes a node's total value among the periods based on the series and the node selected by the user.
The total value can be changed by editing the value inside the box indicated by the arrow, you can choose a different node from the same series or
a node from another series.  
</div> <br />

With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan7.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Let's understand Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values and Append to Values using illustrations:

### Example 1: Spread by Weights with Overwrite Values

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series', 'Overall Result' is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are child
nodes. Overall Result's Calculation Method is the sum of its children. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Here 'East' node's total is changed from 30 to 120 and the weight is applied based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series
'New Series'. Change action is selected as Overwrite Values.  
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/weight ow.png')}
    width={320}
    height={495}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total of 120 is distributed as period values based on the spread of the 'Midwest' node.
The new values of 'East' node take the place of the existing values. The parent node 'Overall Result' also gets changed as a result of this action. 
</div> 

### Example 2: Spread by Weights with Append to Values

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the name of the series is 'New Series', 'Overall Result' is the parent node and 'East' and 'Midwest' are
child nodes. Overall Result's Calculation Method is the sum of its children. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Here 'East' node's total is changed from 30 to 120 and the weight is applied based on another node 'Midwest' from the same series
'New Series'. Change action is selected as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/weight ap.png')}
    width={320}
    height={495}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe from the above Figure, the new total is 120 and the difference between the original total and the new total is 
90 (120-30). Based on the spread of the 'Midwest' node, the difference of 90 is distributed by way of addition to the existing period
values. The parent node 'Overall Result' also gets changed as a result of this action.
</div>

### 3.2 Equals

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Equals distribute a node's new total value equally over the periods. 
With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan8.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Let's understand Equal with Overwrite Values and Append to Values using illustrations:

### Example 3: Equal with Overwrite Values

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 60 to 90 and Change action is selected as Overwrite Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/equals ow.png')}
    width={340}
    height={380}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the new total value of 90 is distributed equally to all the period values. 
The new values of the 'East' take the place of the existing values.
</div>

### Example 4: Equal with Append to Values

Here, the total value of the 'East' node is changed from 60 to 90 and Change action is selected as Append to Values.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/equals ap.png')}
    width={340}
    height={380}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the new total value is 90 and the difference between the original total and the new total is 30 (90-60).
The difference of 30 is now distributed by way of addition to the existing period values.
</div>

### 3.3 Trend

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Trend enables the user to increase/decrease the existing period values of a node - By Percentage or By Value.
With the Change action option, the user can choose to Overwrite Values or Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan9.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 5: Increase Trend By Percentage with Overwrite Values

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is 1000. The Trend is selected as an increase of 10% and Change action
is chosen as Overwrite Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/trend ow.png')}
    width={675}
    height={460}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 1000 and the remaining period values are incremented by 10% of the previous period value. 
The new values of the 'East' take the place of the existing values.
</div>

### Example 6: Increase Trend By Value with Append to Values

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node is 1000. The Trend is selected as an increase by the value of 100 and 
Change action is chosen as Append to Values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/trend ap.png')}
    width={675}
    height={460}/>
 </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
As you can observe, the Jan value of the 'East' node is 1000 and the remaining
period values are incremented by 100 in addition to the existing period values.
</div> <br />

> **Note** <br />
The Increase Trend option accepts both positive and negative values

### 3.4 Copy-to

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Copy-to option takes a node's period value and applies the same value to the remaining periods of that node.
The change gets updated to the parent node as well and is highlighted in yellow as seen below.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan10.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 7: Copy-to

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, the Jan period value of the 'East' node has been copied to all the other period values of the node 
'East' using the option Copy-to. The new values of the 'East' take the place of the existing values and then ValQ re-calculates the total
as a sum of its period values.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan10.1.png')}
    width={675}
    height={240}/>
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.5 Auto Forecast

Auto Forecast enables the user to apply Time Series Forecasting methods to the plan. This option is covered in a separate section,

  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.6 Allocate Children

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
So far we have covered the options that perform allocation horizontally.  
Weight and Equal options under Allocate Children are used to allocate values to the children 
and Copy-to is used to copy a node's value to its sibling nodes.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan12.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.7 Hold and Release

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Hold and Release can be used to lock or unlock cells as needed. The feature can be applied on cell, period, row or column level.
The cells kept on hold does not get affected by any of the allocation methods. 
</div> <br />

  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.9 Refresh Datasource

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Refresh Datasource can be used in case of any changes to the input data.
On clicking Refresh Datasource, the plan gets updated and the allocation performed on the plan gets re-applied on the recent data.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan15.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 3.10 View Allocation History

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>

<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan27.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

> ** Note** <br /> Upon enabling show hidden node, the node stays hidden on the other tabs

## 4. Search for a node

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You can take a look at a particular node and it's children by entering the node name or ID  using the search bar. 
The model along with period values get displayed in a table form. In case, the empty series has been chosen as the series
to start with, only the structure and relationships are displayed and not the values.
</div> <br />
