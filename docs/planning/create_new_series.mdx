<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Click on the Plan icon to open the Plan tab. When you open the Plan tab for the very first time,
ValQ directs you to lock your model before creating a new plan. 
</div> <br />

Locking your model ensures the following:

 - The structure of your model, the nodes and their configuration are fixed and won’t undergo further changes. <br />
 (at least until the planning activities are complete)
 - The reason is that any changes to the underlying model, their relationships, formulae, etc. may make any work-in-progress planning
  activities inaccurate & irrelevant.  

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In this regard, ValQ gives you a warning message saying 'Any changes made in the model will re-calculate all the allocations in each series
and archive the previous steps'. Therefore, we recommend you to finalize your model before you begin to plan.

The following are the steps to create a new plan on ValQ:

 1. Click on the Lock button once you are ready to plan 
 2. Enter the name of the series under Series Name text box
 3. Choose a series to start planning from the drop-down list <br /> 
 (there are two ways by which you can start here – choose <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/planning/create_new_series#create-a-new-plan-based-on-your-most-recent-actualsforecastbudget')}>existing series</Link> or <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/planning/create_new_series#create-a-plan-from-scratch-such-as-zero-based-budget')}>empty series</Link>)
 4. Select the period for which you want to plan from the Periods option  

### Create a new plan based on your most recent actuals/forecast/budget

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Let’s take an example where we would like to create a 2021 Budget based on 2020 Actuals (or most recent forecast). 
In this case, we would select 2020 Actuals from the dropdown and name the new series as 2021 Budget. 
We’ll be able to adjust the baseline for 2021 once the new series is created.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You also have the option to customize the period range – especially if you are creating a new rolling forecast for the next ‘n’ months. 
(In this case, we have left it for all months from Jan to Dec as it is the budget for the year 2021)

  </Zoom>
</div> <br />
 
<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The following shows the result on the Plan screen. You can use the slider at the bottom to view the rest of the periods.

### Create a plan from scratch (such as zero-based budget)

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Let’s assume you would like to create a zero-based budget for the year 2021. 
For this scenario, you will select the Empty Series from the drop-down. 
However, note that the Periods option is disabled when choosing the Empty Series option.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/plan3.1.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

The result is a blank template on which we can start keying in our new plan.
