<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
ValQ’s Plan tab enables you to intuitively perform planning, budgeting & allocations through an editable table interface.
</ div>

The most common use cases of the Plan tab are as follows:
 - Create a new plan/budget based on an existing data series
 - Create a new plan from scratch (Zero-based Budgeting)
 - Perform Time Series Forecasting
 - Update an existing plan/forecast by leveraging various allocation methods
 - Plan continuously by creating a rolling forecast

Take a look at the Plan tab below

:::important
Plan tab is on read only mode while you are on Power BI's Reading view. Switch from Reading view to Edit view to use the plan grid.

:::note
All the Plan Tab features are fully unlocked in Professional and Enterprise plan.
In other plans, the features are available with an upgrade pop-up  message.

## What's the difference between the Plan & Simulate tabs?

There are two major differences:

### 1.Base Data Series vs. Scenario Data

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The Simulate tab’s purpose is to run simulations visually, create & compare multiple scenarios on-the-fly on the underlying data. The underlying data 
used by Simulate tab (referred to by the term ‘base data series’) usually comes from an external source such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database.
This base data series cannot be directly modified in the Simulate tab (to maintain the integrity of data). Instead of using the base data series, 
the Simulate tab allows us to create several scenarios (with each scenario operating on a copy of the base data series). 
As a result, there is a logical separation between base data series (the original data supplied to the model) vs. scenario data 
(scenarios created by users).
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
But what if the base data series itself needs to be updated? <br />
In such operations, we leverage the Plan tab where we can create a copy of the base data series, update it and use it as a new reference based on which you can create additional
scenarios.
</div>

### 2.Top-down Spreading & Distribution

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the Simulate tab, any changes you simulate at a particular node rolls up to the top. However, it does not ‘allocate’ the impact of such as 
simulation to its children.
</ div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The Plan tab, however, does both bottom-up as well as top-down allocations. For example, changes to sales projections for a product can be proportionally allocated to
geographies or SKUs. Several top-down allocation methods are supported.
</ div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Overall, the Simulate tab is meant for executives who are interested in the overall outcomes and impact analysis due to any changes. 
The Plan tab is meant to ensure that plans/forecasts created by planners are consistent and accurate at all levels.
