## The Plan Tab

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
ValQ’s plan tab allows you to intuitively perform planning, budgeting & allocations through an editable table interface.
</ div> <br />

The most common use cases of the Plan tab are as follows:
 - Create a new plan/budget based on an existing data series
 - Create a new plan from scratch (Zero-based Budgeting)
 - Perform Time Series Forecasting
 - Update an existing plan/forecast by leveraging various allocation methods
 - Plan continuously by creating a rolling forecast

Take a look at the Plan tab below

## What is the difference between the Plan vs. Simulate tabs?
 <br /> 
There are two major differences:

## 1.Base Data Series vs. Scenario Data

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The Simulate tab’s purpose is to create & compare multiple scenarios on-the-fly on the underlying data. The underlying data (referred to by the term ‘base data series’
usually comes from an external source such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database. This underlying data source cannot be directly modified in the Simulate tab 
(to maintain integrity of data). Instead, the Simulate tab allows us to create several scenarios on top of this base data series (with each scenario operating 
on a copy of the base data series). As a result, there is a logical separation between base data series (the original data supplied to the model) vs. scenario data 
(scenarios created by users).
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
But what if the baseline data itself needs to be updated? <br />
Consider this use case where you need to utilize the actuals for 2020 to create a baseline budget for 2021. Here instead of simulating for 2021, it is better 
to create a new baseline plan for 2021, on which multiple simulations can be run. That’s where the Plan tab can help.
</div> <br />

In short, the Plan tab can be used whenever the base data itself needs a permanent change. 

## 2.Top-down Spreading & Distribution

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the Simulate tab, any changes you simulate at a particular node rolls up all the way to the top. However, it does not ‘allocate’ the impact of such as 
simulation to its children.
</ div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The Plan tab however does both bottom-up as well as top-down allocations. For example, changes to sales projections for a product can be proportionally allocated to
geographies or SKUs. Several top-down allocation methods are supported.
</ div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Overall, the ‘Simulate’ view is meant for executives who are interested the overall outcomes and impact analysis due to any changes. 
The ‘Plan’ tab is meant to ensure that plans/forecasts created by planners are consistent and accurate at all levels.

## Pre-requisite

A blank ValQ model is required before you can start using the Plan tab
