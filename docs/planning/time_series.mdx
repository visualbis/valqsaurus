Following are the 4 _Forecasting Methods_ available:

1. [Auto Forecast](#1-auto-forecast)
1. [Linear Trend](#2-linear-trend)
1. [Moving Average](#3-moving-average)
1. [Weighted Moving Average](#4-weighted-moving-average)

## 1. Auto Forecast

Auto Forecast option automatically predicts Target Node for the Target Period based on Past Data Series & Weights and Source Periods. Growth can be added as an absolute value or percentage growth when needed. This option does not need the Distribution Method as ValQ performs time series forecasting automatically.

Let's understand how ValQ performs time series forecasting with examples to predict 2020 results.

### Example 1: Auto Forecast with No Growth

#### Configuration for Forecasting

In the below example, forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 actuals data with weight as 1
and growth not incorporated.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Auto Forecast with No Growth" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/auto-forecast-no-growth.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

#### Preview of Forecast Results

The below Figure shows the results of Auto Forecasting as per the above configuration with three choices of forecast i.e.
Optimized, Balanced and Conservative. Notice that the Net Growth of Conservative is 0.00% as we didn't add growth in the Forecast
Basis option.

    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf3.2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 2: Auto Forecast with Growth Component

#### Configuration for Forecasting

Here's another example where forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. Auto Forecast is the Forecast Method applied in this example.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf4.1.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

#### Preview of Forecast Results

The below Figure shows the results of Auto Forecasting as per the above configuration with three choices of forecast i.e.
Optimized, Balanced and Conservative. Notice that the Net Growth of Conservative is 10% as we have added a 10% growth in
the Forecast Basis option.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf4.2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

## 2. Linear Trend

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Linear Trend method applies Linear Regression to predicts Target Node for the
  Target Period based on Past Data Series & Weights and Source Periods. Growth
  can be added as an absolute value or percentage growth when needed and the
  Distribution Method can be selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div>

### Example 3: Linear Trend Forecast with Growth Component and Distribution Method as Match

<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Configuration for Forecasting

In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 full year actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is the Linear Trend with 'Match' as the Distribution Method.

</div>


<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf8.1.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Preview of Forecast Results

The below Figure shows the results of forecasting done based on the above configuration. The total for 2020
is predicted by applying the Linear Trend method and Match distributes the total to its periods based on the distribution of only
recent Past Series Data selected with weight in Forecast Basis, here 2019 actuals with weight as 2.

</div>


<div class="center">

    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf8.2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### Example 4: Linear Trend Forecast with Growth Component and Distribution Method as M2M

<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Configuration for Forecasting

Here's another example where forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 full year
actuals with weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is the Linear Trend with 'M2M' as the
Distribution Method.

</div>


<div class="center">

    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf7.1.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Preview of Forecast Results

The below Figure shows the results of forecasting done based on the above configuration. The total for 2020
is predicted by applying the Linear Trend method and M2M distributes the total to its periods based on the distribution of
all Past Series Data selected with weights in Forecast Basis.

</div>


<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/plan/tsf7.2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Note that the distribution of 2020 period values is the only difference
  between the above two examples because of the change in the Distribution
  Method.
</div>

## 3. Moving Average

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Moving Average method computes forecast results of Target Node for the Target
  Period based on Past Data Series & Weights and Source Periods. This method
  predicts by calculating the Moving Average of Past Data Series period values.
  Growth can be added as an absolute value or percentage growth when needed and
  the Distribution Method can be selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div>

### Example 5: Moving Average Forecast without Growth Component and Distribution Method as M2M

<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Configuration for Forecasting

In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on Jul - Dec period values of 2019 and
2018 actuals with weight as 1 for both and no growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is the Moving Average with M2M
as the Distribution Method.

</div>


<div class="center">

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Preview of Forecast Results

The below Figure shows the results of forecasting done based on the above configuration. The total for 2020
is predicted by applying the Moving Average method and M2M distributes the total to its periods based on the distribution of
all Past Series Data selected with weights in Forecast Basis.

  </Zoom>
</div>

## 4. Weighted Moving Average

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  Weighted Moving Average method computes forecast results of Target Node for
  the Target Period based on Past Data Series & Weights and Source Periods. This
  method predicts by calculating the Weighted Moving Average of Past Data Series
  period values with weights applied to it. Growth can be added as an absolute
  value or percentage growth when needed and the Distribution Method can be
  selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div>

### Example 6: Weighted Moving Average Forecast without Growth Component and Distribution Method as M2M

<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>


#### Configuration for Forecasting

In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on Jul - Dec period values of 2019 and
2018 actuals with weight as 2 for Oct-Dec and 1 for Jul-Sep and no growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is the Weighted Moving Average
with M2M as the Distribution Method.
