The standard valQ Custom Visual template contains functionality for
saving and opening a scenario collection.

When clicking the Edit button <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image51" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image49.png')} /> , you will be asked to
provide a Scenario Title Name.

<img alt="Scenario Title Name" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/9.1.png')} />

You will be also able to delete the existing scenario from there using
the Delete button <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image53" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image51.png')} />.

There is also an option to export the value driver tree data set to xml.
It will create an unformatted spreadsheet with the tree and all the node
data.
