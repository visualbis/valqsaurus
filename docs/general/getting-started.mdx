## Instructions for ValQ visual

The ValQ visual provides various components that the Designer can
use in conjunction with Microsoft Power BI. The ValQ visual also
offers many configuration options.

In this guide, we will describe the common end-user functionality using
a demo as an example. It is however important to understand that your
specific implementation may differ.

Once your designer has implemented and configured the ValQ Visual, it will be accessed the same way you access your current Power
BI Apps.

When you open a ValQ Visual, it will open in a similar manner at
the screenshot below:

<img alt="ValQ Screen" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.1.png")} />
<div style={{ fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}> ValQ Screen </div>

The left panel is the navigation panel and on the canvas you will find
the value driver tree. By default, the tree is open on collapsed mode at
a level defined by the designer. This is typically completely collapsed.

As part of the New Release, you will be able to hide the Navigation
Panel in the Runtime by clicking the Collapse button as shown in the
below Figure.

<img
  alt="Hiding Navigation Panel in Runtime"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/navp.png")}
/>

As part of the New Release, you can also switch over from Table View
Mode to Tree View Mode and vice versa using the button as shown in the
below Figure.

<img alt="Table/Tree View Mode" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/tbt.png")} />

## Input Data

The ValQ visual works with two input data series – the primary
and the comparison data series. A common way of using this is to compare
Forecast vs Budget, Budget vs Last Year Actuals etc. The data series is
at a certain time grain. This would typically be 1 year by 12 months or
a multiyear view like 5 years plan by year.

The selecting of the time series will often be based on Filters or
Variables. A typical scenario is where the designer has defined 4
variables on the underlying data sources:

Primary:

Version: ie. Defaulted to Forecast

Year: ie. Defaulted to Current Year

Comparison:

Version ie. Defaulted to Budget

Year ie. Defaulted to Current Year

This allows the users to compare different versions and years in the
value driver tree model.

The ValQ visual can display individual periods but can also apply
time aggregation such as Full Year, Year-to-Date. You can see the
currently selected Value Display aggregation on the Navigation Panel. In
the screenshot above, Full Year is selected. The primary value displayed
on the Widgets is therefore in this instance the Full Year aggregated
data.

## Tree Drill Down

Nodes that has children will have an expand ‘>’ button to the right of
the Widget as highlighted below:

<img alt="Nodes with children" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.2.png")} />

You can drill down the tree by clicking the expand button.

The tree will focus on the branches that are being expanded. You can
collapse any specific node by clicking the ‘<’ collapse button on the
right of a widget.

Value Driver Trees are in reality networks. The same driver may impact
multiple aspects of the Tree. The component therefore contains a concept
of linked nodes. Such nodes have a link

<img
  alt="..image::\/doc-images/image4"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image4.png")}
/> icon that you can click which will jump to where the linked node is defined and
highlight the node:
<img alt="Link" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.3.png")} />
<img alt="Linked Nodes" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.4.png")} />

To collapse all nodes, click on the collapse icon on the bottom left of
the canvas <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image7" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image7.png')} />

## Zoom and Pan

Value Driver Trees can be large. You can zoom and pan the canvas view.
If you are using an iPad or iPhone, you can zoom by pinching and pan by
dragging the same way you would navigate a map.

If you are using a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can point your curser
anywhere in the canvas and scroll the wheel to zoom in and out.

To pan, click and hold the left bottom of the mouse and drag the tree
around.

You can also use the zoom button to zoom if your device doesn’t support
other options <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image8" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image7.png')} />

## Expand/Collapse of Tree View

As part of the New Release, you will be able to expand/collapse the Node
Hierarchy at the required level using the Go To Level button (see Figure
below).

<img alt="Expand/collapse one level" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/exl.png")} />

For our example, the Node Hierarchy level has been selected as third
level.

## Value Display and Simulation Period

<img alt="Value Display" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.5.png")} />

With the ‘Value Display’ functionality you can choose the time
aggregation you want to display as the primary value. The designer can
link certain nodes to a user-selected scaling. You can select the scale
you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section.
Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is
important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value
driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical
volumes.

In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a
secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as
primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the
Month data as secondary:

<img alt="Value Display" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.6.png")} />

The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period
selected.

When **Month** is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation
interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected
period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate,
we generally don’t want to apply a change to the past as we can’t change
it. It is possible to also set the ‘to’ period in a simulation, just
click <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image11" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image10.png')} /> and highlight the
month you want as the end period of a simulation. This is however a
special scenario.

<img alt="Simulation Period" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.7.png")} />

**YTD** – the selected period -1 is the year to date data (eg. selected
simulation period is September to December, the YTD data will be from
Jan to August).

Note: Simulation of future periods will not impact the YTD data.

<img
  alt="Value Display and Simulation Period"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.8.png")}
/>

**Full Year** – Shows the full year cumulated data

<img
  alt="Value Display and Simulation Period"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.9.png")}
/>

**Sim. Period** – to simulate a specific period, for example a 3 month
rolling forecast from September to November, click the first month
September then click <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image15" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image10.png')} />and
click the last month November for simulation. You can then choose to
only show the values aggregated for the selected simulation periods

<img
  alt="Value Display and Simulation Period"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.10.png")}
/>

As part of the New Release, you will be able to view the Tooltip for all
the Value Displays. For our example, the Tooltip for the Month Value
Display is shown in below Figure.

<img
  alt="Tooltip for Month Value Display"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/vd1.png")}
/>

Similarly you can view the Tooltip for other Value Displays.

## Sub Models - Filters

If your Value Driver Tree is large, the designer may have defined
specific sub views. These would be listed under the Sub Models Section
of the Navigation Panel. When clicking on one of these views, the tree
will be filtered and the specific node will be made the top node.
Calculation dependencies are still respected but this significantly
improves the navigation as it focuses the tree on a specific area.

In this example, the options defined are:

- Open all company level: Net Profit
- Open per department: Mining, Processing or the operational tree for
  Mill Throughput

<img alt="Sub Models – Filters" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.11.png")} />

## KPIs

The Navigation Panel can be configured to list a set of KPI’s from the
value driver tree. You are able to navigate to each of them for a fast
view on the simulation impact on a given KPI. Click on the KPI to
navigate to the node.

<img alt="KPIs" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.12.png")} />

## Data Simulation

There are 2 options to simulate:

- Hover over a desired node to simulate, slide the scaling button to
  right for positive impact or left for negative impact. The
  simulation will be showed on the right-hand side. A window will open
  displaying the changes. The pencil icon will display the change in
  percentage that has been made:
  <img
    alt="..image::\/doc-images/image19"
    src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image17.png")}
  />
  , and a legend with percentage showing if the adjust has made the scenario better
  or worse <img
    alt="..image::\/doc-images/image20"
    src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image18.png")}
  />
  .

<img alt="Data Simulation" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.13.png")} />

- Click on the arrow icon of the node
  <img
    alt="..image::\/doc-images/image22"
    src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image20.png")}
  /> then click ‘Edit Key Input’ <img
    alt="..image::\/doc-images/image23"
    src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image21.png")}
  /> and manually edit the changes in simulation per period. Click X to close manual
  input table.

Notes

- You can update the periods highlighted in YELLOW based on the
  selected simulation period.

<img alt="Simulation Periods" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.14.png")} />

The edit icon will indicate the months that have been edited.

<img alt="Simulation Periods" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.15.png")} />

- You can update the ‘Variation’ column which will overwrite the
  numbers in the selected simulation periods. Any manual updates in
  period will not be overwritten by the ‘Variation’ column. In the
  example below, in blue are the months which were manually edited and
  in orange are highlighted the variation and in this case the month
  to which the variation was applied.

<img alt="Simulation Periods" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.16.png")} />

Click reset icon to return to the original data

<img
  alt="..image::\/doc-images/image27"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image25.png")}
/>
.

As part of the New Release, you can simulate the Node having "0" as the
value. When the slider is moved to the right end, it will show positive
values and when the slider is moved to the left end, it will show
negative values. The property of the Simulation remains the same for the
Change Percentage, Manual, Growth Percentage and Constant options.

<img
  alt='Simulated Node having "0" as values'
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/zero1.png")}
/>

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Growth Percentage has
been selected as an option.

## Key Inputs

Key Inputs is available on the left side panel to directly simulate key
cost drivers without going into the node details.

Click the ‘Edit Key Input’ icon

<img
  alt="..image::\/doc-images/image28"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image26.png")}
/>{" "}

and manually edit the changes in simulation per periods.

<img alt="Key Inputs" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.17.png")} />

Notes:

- Can update the periods highlighted in YELLOW based on the selected
  simulation period. All the changes in the Key Assumptions are
  highlighted in the left side panel side.

<img alt="Simulation Periods" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.18.png")} />

Click X to close manual input table.

- Click a Key Assumption or Key Performance Indicator and it will
  highlight the source nodes to further check the details.

<img alt="Key Inputs" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.19.png")} />

All simulations are highlighted in the upper right corner.

<img
  alt="..image::\/doc-images/image32"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/media/image30.png")}
/>

Click <img alt="..image::\/doc-images/image33" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/media/image31.png')} /> to return to the
original selected version without any simulation.

When more number of simulations are done, you will be able to view the
More button in the upper right corner. By clicking the More button, you
will be able to see the remaining simulations as shown in the below
Figure.

<img
  alt="Simulations - More option button"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/more.png")}
/>

## Scenarios Functionality

You can create multiple scenarios in parallel, compare them as well as
sharing the collection with others.

This is how you do it.

- Create a Scenario 1 by clicking the “+” button in the Navigation
  Panel (see Figure below).

<img alt="Create Scenario" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf1.png")} />

- You can view the Context Drop Down Menu as shown in the below
  Figure.

<img alt="Context Drop Down Menu" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf2.png")} />

- After clicking the Context Drop Down Menu, you will be able to view
  the Menu items such as Copy Scenario, Edit and Delete Functions (see
  Figure below).

<img
  alt="Context Drop Down Menu Items"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf3.png")}
/>

- When you click the “Copy Scenario” Menu Item, you will be able to
  create the Scenario 2 with the same configuration as done for
  Scenario 1.

<img alt="Scenario 1" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf4.png")} />

The above Figure shows the settings for Scenario 1. When you click the
“Copy Scenario” Menu Item, you will be able to view the Scenario 2
being created with the same set of configuration done for Scenario 1
(see Figure below).

<img alt="Scenario 2" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf5.png")} />

The copied scenario is the replicate of the last scenario (e.g. Scenario
2 will have the same data from the copied Scenario 1.

- By clicking the “Edit” Menu Item, you will be able to edit the
  Scenario (see Figure below).

<img alt="Scenario 1 Edit" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf6.png")} />

From the above Figure, you can observe that you will be able to edit the
labels for the Title and Description for the selected Scenario.

- By clicking the “Delete” Menu Item, you will be able to delete the
  entire Scenario.
- Click ‘Create a new Scenario and make it the active scenario’ icon
  as shown below

<img
  alt="Create a new Scenario and make it the active scenario
icon"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sfi1.png")}
/>

This will create a new Scenario and will highlight the created Scenario
as the active scenario.

- Click ‘Compare Scenario’ icon to generate a report comparison format
  with the key Assumptions and KPI’s (see Figure below).

<img alt="Compare Scenario icon" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sfi2.png")} />

- Comparison report compares all scenarios that have been created in
  the active collection. It also shows the Simulated Data Scenario
  (Baseline: Full Year), Comparison Version (Full Year) and Simulated
  Data Scenario Year to Date (Baseline: YTD).
- From the below Figure, the GREEN fonts denotes the most favorable
  results and the RED fonts denotes the least favorable result in the
  scenario comparison report.

<img
  alt="Full Year Scenario Comparison"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf7.png")}
/>
<img
  alt="Full Year Scenario Comparison"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf8.png")}
/>

As part of the New Release, you will be able to download the excel file
of the compared scenarios based on your choice by clicking the "Download
to Excel" option in the Scenario Comparison screen as shown below.

<img
  alt="Download option in Scenario Comparison screen"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/scom1.png")}
/>

You can select the Scenario and download the excel file as shown in the
below Figure.

<img alt="Scenario selection" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/scom2.png")} />

- You have the option to make additional simulation in the new
  scenario or click the icon appearing in the top most right pane to
  return to the original selected version without any simulation and
  then make a new simulation (see Figure below).

<img alt="Reset All icon" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sfi3.png")} />

- Click the Download icon located in the Scenarios Section to extract
  the report in xml format (see Figure below).

<img alt="Download icon" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sfi4.png")} />

- Click the icon for write back functionality (see Figure below). By
  clicking this option you will be able to write back/post ValQ data
  to a configured URL in the server.

<img alt="Write back icon" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sfi5.png")} />

By clicking the Configure URL to write back the current scenario option,
you will be able to select any one among the two different options to
write back the current scenario to the configured URL in the server (see
Figure below).

<img alt="Write back options" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/wb1.png")} />

- The created Scenarios can be reordered based on our choice by a
  simple drag and drop options. For our example, you have reordered
  the Scenarios as shown in the below Figure.

<img alt="Reordered Scenarios" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf9.png")} />

Based on the reordered scenarios, you will be able to view the
Comparison Report with the similar reordered hierarchy as shown in the
below Figure.

<img
  alt="Comparison Report with reordered Scenarios"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/sf10.png")}
/>

## Constraints

Constraints are also available in the left side panel that identifies
the metrics that are overcapacity (highlighted in RED fonts) or still
have opportunities for further improvements (WHITE fonts).

Notes:

- RED fonts means over capacity as compared to the maximum limit.
  (e.g. Production Rate 1.680 tonnes per hour is over capacity as
  compared to the maximum limit of 1.600 tonnes per hour).
- WHITE fonts means still have opportunities for improvement as
  compared to the maximum limit.

<img alt="Constraints" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.23.png")} />
<img alt="Constraints" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.24.png")} />

## Visualization

Visualization is available in the left side Navigation panel which helps
the users view the Tree in the Table or Tree format based on their
choice. By using the View Mode, the user can select three different view
modes namely Full, Standard and Minimal to view the Tree or Table
Format.

The below Figure represents the Tree View Format with the View Mode
being selected as "Full". Here you can observe that the Nodes will be
displayed in Full mode.

<img
  alt="Visualization - Display as Tree and View Mode selected as
Full"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.25.png")}
/>

The below Figure represents the Table View Format with the View Mode
being selected as "Standard". Here you can observe that the Table view
will show the Primary value, Comparison value, Variance and Variance %
values for the Full Year.

<img
  alt="Visualization - Display as Table and View Mode selected as
Standard"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/4.26.png")}
/>

When the View Mode is selected as "Full", then you will be able to view
the Table with Primary value, Comparison value, Variance and Variance %
values for the Full Year and also the same set of values for the Month.

When the View Mode is selected as "Minimal", then you will be able to
view only the Primary value and Comparison value for the Full Year.

## Contextual Help Information

As part of the New Release, the Contextual Help Information feature has
been included in the Advance Editor window by which the user can be
directed to the specific help page. For our example, navigate to the
Settings Tab and click the Navigation Panel. You can view the Contextual
Help Information icon (see Figure below).

<img
  alt="Icon for Contextual Help Information"
  src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/con1.png")}
/>

By clicking the Contextual Help Information icon, you will be redirected
to the Help Information page for the Navigation Panel.
