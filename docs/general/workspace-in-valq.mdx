Workspace is an account provisioned for the users of ValQ.
ValQ workspaces underpin the per-user licensing model, wherein you can effectively manage your workspaces' licensing & user community by tracking, adding/removing users, and assigning roles.
It also allows these users to collaborate on their ValQ models.

You can visit https://valq.com/pricing/ to know more about our licensing options.

You can setup and manage your workspace by following the below
instructions.

## 1. Creating a workspace

You can create a workspace at ValQ.com website by signing up for the Free Trial or purchasing ValQ from the shop.
At this point, you should also specify the number of users you plan to
add to this workspace. The workspace name given here cannot be modified.

Upon creation, you will be assigned as the workspace admin by default,
and a link to the workspace admin console is shared to your e-mail
address. As an admin, you can invite other users to the workspace
for collaboration. Workspace members can utilize ValQ features, as per the pricing plan selected.

## 2. Inviting other users to the workspace

You can invite other users to the workspace from the Admin Console.
After signing up and logging in at the admin portal, you can go to the
'User Manager' section, click 'Add Members' and fill in the users' email
address to extend the invitation to the workspace. The invited members
would receive an email notification. The members can sign into ValQ
using the 'Login' button.

## 3. Assigning roles to the workspace users

As an admin, you can choose between 'Member' and 'Admin' as roles for
the users in the workspace. You can also remove any users, if needed.
This is available at the 'User Manager' section in the admin console.

## 4. Choosing a workspace

If you have access to multiple workspaces, you can choose
between these workspaces while logging in at the ValQ custom visual.

If you are an admin managing different workspaces, you can also choose
between workspaces during the login. Additionally, you can select or
switch between these workspaces at the profile dropdown within Admin
Console.
