The Data Series tab helps you to configure the data series
settings for the model created in ValQ. There are 3 different options as
listed below under the data series settings.

## 1. Data Series Manager

Data Series Manager helps you to configure the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/model/data-series#11-periods')}>Periods</Link> and <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/model/data-series#12-data-series')}>Data Series</Link> for the model.

  </Zoom>
</div>

### 1.1 Periods

**Period(s) per data series**: Enter the number of periods in the data here. <br />
**Period Label(s)**: Enter the period labels here with a comma separating each label.<br />
The changes made here to the Period Labels will be reflected in all the 4 tabs on ValQ - Model,
Plan, Simulate and Analyze including the PopUp screen.

### 1.2 Data Series

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
First, toggle Include comparison data series to add a comparison data series when needed. In case there are two data series to the model,
you can keep one as Baseline data series and the other as Comparison data series. The data series can be actuals and budget,
multiple years of data, etc. The names of the series are Baseline and Comparison by default, you can double click on the name or 
click on the pencil icon beside the name to customize.      
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
For our example, we have the data source having periods from Jan to Dec,
Budget and Forecast values. The Budget values will be the Comparison
values and the Forecast values will be the Baseline values. Follow the
below steps for configuring the values in the Data Series Manager.
</div> <br />

1.  Set the property Period(s) per data series to the value 5.
2.  Configure the Period Labels as Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May (see Figure
    above).
3.  Enable the property Include comparison data series. You can view
    both the Baseline and Comparison values.
4.  When the property Include comparison data series is disabled, then
    you will be able to view only the Baseline Series.
5.  When you click the Baseline label, you will be able to view the
    Baseline values as Forecast values as shown below. Now the label 
    has been changed to Sales Forecast.

</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You can observe from the above Figure that the data series names are displayed on top of the screen,
the period labels are displayed in the tooltip and after simulating the 'East node', you will be able to 
view the Baseline data in comparison with simulated Baseline data.
</div>

## 2. Time Aggregation Labels

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Using the Time Aggregation Labels option, you can
configure the aggregation labels of the periodic variances. The changes made here will 
get reflected in the nodes and Value Display of the Simulate tab.  
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
<img alt="New Tab" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/model/ds6.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<img alt="New Tab" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/model/ds7.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below Figure, you can see the Period Labels and Time Aggregation
Labels as highlighted in the ValQ screen under the Simulate tab.
