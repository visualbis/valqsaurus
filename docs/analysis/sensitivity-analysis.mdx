In a business model, you can now analyze how different input variables affect the selected target node in the form of a tornado chart.

The sensitivity analysis feature allows you to select the input nodes to be simulated and the percentage of variance to determine the result on the output node. A summary of all the resulted sensitivity analysis reports helps in a deeper analysis of the key performance nodes.

## Key Features

- The analysis is done by selecting one output driver(node) from the model and selecting up to 20 input drivers.
- The percentage variation is provided as input. If 10% is provided as an input all the input nodes will be simulated by +10% and -10% and recorded value for the output will be plotted in the tornado chart.
- A summary report of multiple tornado charts helps in a deeper analysis.
- Usually, the tornado analysis is performed on the historical Series as a precursor to the planning operation, but we will allow the user to select a series and run the analysis for flexibility.

## Create a Sensitivity Analysis chart

Let's consider a Mining model where the  **Net Profit** has a base value of $56.8m.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Mining Model"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/mining-model.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Mining Model with Key input nodes highlighted</p>
</div>

Say, you want to analyze how multiple *key Inputs* - *Copper Price, Diesel Price*, and *Mill Throughput* value change will affect the overall *Net Profit*. 

1. Go to **Analyze > Sensitivity Analysis**

 <div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Sensitivity Analysis"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/sensitivity-analysis-option.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Select Sensitivity Analysis option</p>
 </div>

1. Fill in the **New Sensitivity Chart** with the following fields: 
   - **Analysis Name**: A relevant name of the chart
   - **Series**: Select the Series from the drop-down list
   - **Output Node**: The resultant node that is affected by the simulation
   - **Deviation**: Percentage of variance applied on the input nodes. This value must be between 1 and 100.
   - **Period Measure**: Time period is "Month", "Full Year", and "Simulated months".

   <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
     <img
      alt="New Sensitivity Chart"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/create-analysis.png")}
     />
    </Zoom>
    <p>New Sensitivity Analysis chart fields</p>
   </div>

1. Click **Next**
 - In the **Node Selection** window, click the plus (+) sign next to the 3 *Key Input* nodes to select them.
   - Start typing a node's name in the **Search** box to search for the related node.

 <div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Select input nodes"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/select-input-nodes.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Key input nodes selected in the right pane</p>
 </div>

 :::note
 You can select up to 20 nodes.

 - Click **Save**.

Your *Sensitivity Analysis* chart will be created as shown in the screenshot below:

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Sensitivity Analysis chart for Net Profit"
      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/sensitivity-analysis-chart.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Sensitivity Analysis chart for Net Profit</p>
</div>

As you hover over each input node's bar, each node indicates the same **Base** value ($56.81m) as *Net Profit*, **Variance** change in the value, and the resulted **Low** and **High** output node values when the input node is simulated by +/- Deviation percentage.

### Edit the Analysis report

Once you create your report, use the top menu label to edit the report.  
You can edit the report's *Name*, *Series*, *Output Node*, *Deviation* percentage, time *Period*, and *Input Nodes*.
The report is auto-updated and saved to your workspace.

### Sensitivity Analysis based simulation

Go to the **Simulate** tab and simulate the *Mill Throughput* node by +/- 10%.
The simulation affects the *Net Profit* output node and changes the value to $93.1m as depicted by our *Sensitivity Analysis* report.

  <Zoom>

      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/simulate-node-better.png")}
    />

      src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/analyze/simulate-node-worst.png")}
    />
  </Zoom>
  <p>Input node deviation (-10%) effect on the output node</p>
</div>

## Sensitivity Analysis summary

To get a consolidated view of all the analysis reports, click **View Summary** at the top right corner on the *Sensitivity Analysis* screen.

  <p>Sensitivity Analysis summary</p>
</div>

:::note
When an input node has no direct effect on the output node, the tornado chart displays no bar for the input driver. 
As is the case in the *Mining* report, the input nodes *Recovery* and *Copper Sold* do not affect the *Mining* node.
