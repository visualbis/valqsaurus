The Analyze Tab allows the user to run advanced analyses on the data.
ValQ provides Variance Analysis and Attribute Analysis. Several other features
such as Sensitivity Analysis are to be released in the upcoming versions.

Variance Analysis displays the variance between the Base and Compared
series across all nodes in the model.

On clicking the 'Analyze' Tab, you will be able to view the Variance
Analysis option.

The Variance Analysis page is displayed which has an action menu on the top and a table below.

## Action Menu

The menu lets you make the following selections.

## 1. Baseline series and Comparison series

You can choose the baseline and comparison series here. 

The series that were created in the 'Plan' Tab can also be selected as
Baseline Series or Comparison Series by clicking on the drop-down.

The scenarios created in Simulate Tab can also be accessed as shown.

## 2. Period Selection

The primary period across which the series are to be compared can be
customized by clicking on the drop-down below.

Custom periods can be defined by selecting 'Custom' in the period dropdown and selecting the desired period in the below dialog box.

Multiple time frames can be compared at once. For example, Half Year and Full Year can be analysed by selecting from the dropdown. 

<img alt="Customizing Periods" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-11.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

Custom periods can be defined here as well. 

<img alt="Customizing Periods" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-12.png')} width="60%" height="60%" />

## 3. Absolute Variance, % Variance and Show unit

You can choose to analyse only the absolute variance, % variance or both by selecting the appropriate check boxes.

<img alt="Variance Display" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-13.png')} width="50%" height="50%" />

The units associated with the KPIs can be displayed or hidden using the check box.

## 4. Download as Excel

It is possible to download the results of the analysis as an Excel file
when using Power BI Service.

<img alt="Downloading as Excel" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-15.png')} width="25%" height="25%" />

The downloaded analysis looks like the one shown below.

## 5. Show Hidden Nodes

Nodes that are hidden in the Simulate Tab can be viewed here by checking the option.

## 6. Search

Nodes can be searched using the search bar. As you enter the name, the dropdown displays the nodes that match.

## 7. Filter

The 'Filter' option has the ability to filter the nodes based on the parent node and the 
variance values. 

<img alt="Filter" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-18.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

If you want to filter by parent, choose the node in the dropdown. By default, all the child nodes will be displayed.

<img alt="Filtering by parent" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-19.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

If you only want specific nodes, you can select the 'Selected Children' option and then choose the desired nodes.

<img alt="Filtering selected children by parent" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-20.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

To filter by variance, 

- enter the number of nodes in the 'Show top' field 

- select the time period based on which the filter is to be applied

<img alt="Filtering selected children by variance - time period" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-21.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

- select the baseline and comparison series 

<img alt="Filtering selected children by variance - series" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/VA-22.png')} width="30%" height="30%" />

- select whether you would like all the variances to be displayed or only positive/negative variances
