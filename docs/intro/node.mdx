import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl"; // Add to the top of the file below the front matter.
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import Zoom from "react-medium-image-zoom";

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
With ValQ, you can build a model of your business process and view it in the form of a tree as well as table. Toggle between the below icons 
present on top left corner of the canvas to change the view.  
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node8.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>

## Tree View

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The tree structure is presented in horizontal format as a visual.  Just like a tree,
ValQ model has a stem on top called top node and the top node then branches out to others nodes. 
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node7.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The model is segmented into levels starting from level 1 with top node, here it's 'Overall Result'. The nodes share a parent-child relationship at each level
for example, 'East' node is the parent node while 'Consumer' node is a child node, 'Consumer' node is the parent node while 'Chris Morris' node is a child node. </div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node2.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

Click on '>' to expand and '<' collapse levels.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node6.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

You can also use the 'Go to level ^' option present on bottom of the canvas to navigate between levels of the tree.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

Now let's take a look at what makes up a node.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node4.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div>
<br />

Each node represents a value driver, KPI or category and it's several performance metrics. Here's how to interpret a node:

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}} className="table-center">

|   |   Component	| Description  	|
|---    |---	|---	|
|1| Node name  	| Name of the value driver or KPI	|
|2| Conditional Formatting  	| Color band indicating the variance 	|
|3| Value Trend 	| A sparkline line graph showing the trend |
|4| Baseline Value  	| Node value of the baseline series |
|5| Variance for all periods  	| Full year variance of the node |
|6| Variance for current period  	| Current month (usually first period in the series) month variance of the node |
|7| Absolute Variance  | Variance shown in absolute value |
|8| Percentage Variance  	| Variance shown in percentage |

</div> <br />

> **Note** <br />
Variance is calculated as difference between Baseline series and Comparison series

Baseline series is the primary series and Comparison series is the benchmark against which the Baseline is compared.
Here Sales Budget is the Baseline series and Sales Forecast is the Comparison series.

  </Zoom>    
</div>

## Table View

The same information can be viewed in tabular form as see in the image below. The Table view is generally used to plan and analye the data.  <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/intro/node10.png')} />
  </Zoom>    
</div> <br />
