In this section, we introduce you the components of a node and two types of model structure available in ValQ

1. [Node Components](#1-node-components)
1. [Model structure](#2-model-structure)

## 1. Node components

First, let's take a look at what makes up a node

    />

</div>

Each node represents a value driver, KPI or category and it's several performance metrics. Here's how to interpret a node:

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}} className="table-center">

|     | Component                   | Description                                                                   |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Node name                   | Name of the value driver or KPI                                        |
| 2   | Conditional Formatting      | Color band indicating the variance                                            |
| 3   | Value Trend                 | A sparkline graph showing the trend                                           |
| 4   | Baseline Value              | Node value of the baseline series                                             |
| 5   | Variance for all periods    | Full-year variance of the node                                                |
| 6   | Variance for current period | Current month (usually first period in the series) month variance of the node |
| 7   | Absolute Variance           | Variance showed in absolute value                                             |
| 8   | Percentage Variance         | Variance showed in percentage                                                 |

Lengthy Node name is truncated in the Tree view to avoid overlapping on other values.

> Variance is calculated as the difference between the Baseline series and Comparison series


Baseline series is the primary series and Comparison series is the benchmark
against which the Baseline is compared. <br /> In the below image Sales Budget is the Baseline series and Sales Forecast is the Comparison series.

</div>

## 2. Model structure

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  With ValQ, you can build a model of your business process and view it in the
  form of a tree as well as a table. Toggle between the below icons present on
  the top left corner of the canvas to change the view.
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node8.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 2.1 Tree view

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The tree structure is presented in a horizontal format as a visual. Just like
  a tree, ValQ model has a stem on Top called Top node and the Top node then
  branches out to other nodes.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node7.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>
<br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The model is segmented into levels starting from level 1 with Top node as 'Overall Result'. The nodes share a parent-child relationship at each
  level. For example, the 'East' node is the Parent node while 'Consumer' is a Child node. The 'Consumer' node is the Parent node while 'Chris Morris' is a Child node.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node2.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

Click on **>** to expand and **<** collapse levels.

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node6.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  You can use the search option to search and get to that particular node, zoom
  slider to zoom in/out of the canvas and Go to level ^ option to navigate
  between different levels.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node9.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div>

### 2.2 Table view

<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
  The same information can be viewed in tabular form as see in the image below.
  The Table view is generally used to plan and analyze the data. Click on the
  table icon as highlighted below to get the tabular view.
</div> <br />

<div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="ValQ users" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/intro/node10.png")} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />
