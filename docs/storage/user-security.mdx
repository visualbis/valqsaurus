ValQ Collaborate (Enterprise Edition) introduces security features to restrict access to your models/nodes, scenarios, planning series to a given set of users and groups.

The security feature helps you to manage the view/edit access on your model for users or groups.
User and group management is administered through <Link to={useBaseUrl('storage/admin-console')}>Admin console</Link> page.

## Security Roles and Level of Permissions

You can manage the model level data security by using roles and then adding users to these different roles. A role has certain access controls and permissions.

### Understand the User Roles

User security roles define a set of access privileges in ValQ model functionalities such as Model, Nodes, Scenarios, Planning series, Comments, etc. 

The following table describes the privileges of a user role in ValQ: 

| Security Role | Privileges                                                                                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**     | Create and edit model/scenarios/series                                                                                                                              | Admin role can be assigned to a user or group by the *Model creator<sup>1</sup>* or other admins.  Note: The model/scenario can be deleted only by the *Model creator* |
| **Analyzer**  | <ul><li>Cannot access the Model tab</li><li>Can copy, edit, share, download and compare shared scenarios</li><li>Cannot delete the shared scenario/series</li></ul> | This role has read/write access on the shared scenarios/series and read access on the nodes.                                                                           |
| **Viewer**    | View shared model, nodes and scenarios                                                                                                                              | This role has view-only access on the shared model and scenarios by default. **Note**: A viewer can be granted edit<sup>2</sup> permissions on certain features.       |

- <sup>1</sup>Model creator/owner is the default Admin who can add other users as admins or members.
- <sup>2</sup>ValQ features when shared with the "Limited to certain users" option, only selected users or groups can be given view-only or edit access.

### Scope of User Roles in ValQ features 

The scope of the access is defined by the user’s roles and permissions granted in the ValQ visuals by the *Model creator* or an *Admin*. 
Following are the privileges assigned on the shared model:

| Feature                                                 | Admin                                 | Analyzer                              | Viewer                                |

<sup>2</sup>ValQ features when shared with the "Limited to certain users" option, only selected users/groups are given view-only or edit access.

## Manage Model Access 

The *Model owner(default Admin)* can add other members to the model with the above-defined roles as *Admin, Analyzer*, or a *Viewer*.
* Before you begin, you must **Upload** your model to the workspace.
* Click on the 3 dots `...` next to your User profile and select **Settings**.
* In the **Model Settings > Security** section add other users/groups to the model.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Add users/groups to a model" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/storage/user-security-roles.png')} />
    </Zoom>
    <p>Add users/groups and assign model-level user roles</p>
  </div>  

* Following are the users/roles:
  - testQA user1 is added as an *Admin*.
  - ValQ Test User as an *Analyzer*.
  - finance-group as a *Viewer*. All the members (user3, user4) of the group are assigned *Viewer* level access.

> A user can view the assigned model-level roles and permissions in the *Model Settings* side panel as shown in the above screenshot.

- Case 1: *Admin* has complete access to the **Model** Tab and sub-menus. An *Admin* can edit/add/delete the *Nodes*. Also is allowed to edit the user security access on the model to other users.
- Case 2: *Analyzer* and *Viewer* do not have access to the Model tab as shown in the below screenshot.
