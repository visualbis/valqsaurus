## Admin Dashboard

 </div>

    - A *Billing Admin* can upgrade the *Collaborate* plan by clicking on the **Upgrade** button.
- **Profile**: This section lists the User *Name*, and *Email* of the logged-in user.

## Manage Users in the Workspace

Anyone who has an administrator role in a workspace can give access to other users in that workspace by adding them to various roles. Workspace creators automatically become administrators.

**User Manager** page provides functionalities to add/remove members and assign *roles* and *groups* to members.

### Invite other users to the Workspace

* Click **Add Member** button at the top right corner to add a new member and enter the **Email** address.
   
 <div class="center">
  <Zoom>
    <img alt="Add members to a workspace" src={useBaseUrl("/doc-images/storage/admin-console/add-member.png")} />
  </Zoom>
  <p>An Admin can add new members to the workspace</p>
 </div>

* Click **Add**.

The invited members would receive an email notification and link to sign into ValQ.

### ValQ Sign-in Methods

ValQ allows 2-way sign-in methods. This additional method would allow customers/prospects to use ValQ without obtaining Office 365 Admin Consent to authorize ValQ app.
The users can sign-in to ValQ visual using both:

1. **Microsoft Sign-in**: The user can login using Microsoft Office 365 account.
1. **Native User Sign-in**: The user can login using the username/password managed by ValQ service.

A typical native user sign-in workflow:
1. Workspace Admin adds a member/user to a workspace by email.
1. ValQ will send the new member an email with the workspace name and a password reset link (The link will be valid for 7 days).
1. The user clicks on the link and resets the account password.
1. The user is now logged in to the assigned workspace via Admin console portal.
1. When a user tries to Log-in from the ValQ visual, the link will be redirected to the same sign-in page. However, the user can now use its username/password to sign-in.

User actions:
* The users can also choose to link their Microsoft Sign-in account. To do so, click on the user profile in the bottom left panel, click **Profile Settings**. Click **Sign in with Microsoft**.
* To update the password, a user must go to Profile Settings and click **Change Password**.
* To recover a lost password, go to the Admin console sign-in page and click **Forgot password**.
Enter your Email and click **Reset Password**. A password reset link will be sent on your registered email id.
