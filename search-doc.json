Note You have the option to display only positive variances or only negative variances or both In this example, filter By Variance has been applied to filter the top 5 variances for the Full Year. Filter by Variance The below image shows the Variance Analysis for the top 5 variances for the full year. Observe the results to see both positive and negative variances. The Value Bar displays the filter that has been applied. Report filtered by top 5 variances To remove the filter simply click on the 'X' next to the filter.

The underlying data used by Simulate tab (referred to by the term ‘base data series’) usually comes from an external source such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database. This base data series cannot be directly modified in the Simulate tab (to maintain the integrity of data). Instead of using the base data series, the Simulate tab allows us to create several scenarios (with each scenario operating on a copy of the base data series). As a result, there is a logical separation between base data series (the original data supplied to the model) vs. scenario data (scenarios created by users).   But what if the base data series itself needs to be updated? In such operations, we leverage the Plan tab where we can create a copy of the base data series, update it and use it as a new reference based on which you can create additional scenarios.

Provide node/scenarios/series level access permission roles to different users/groups.Scenario Collaboration - Collaborate and share your scenarios with other users and groups in the workspace.Export data source - Export scenarios, planning series, etc., from ValQ as a web data source that can be consumed readily from other BI tools for analysis.Comments - Share and collaborate your models and comments on Planning and ScenariosHistory Logs - The history of changes in model/scenarios/series/writeback is maintained in chronological order. The history logs are shared among users and can also be restored.Model Merge - Compose complex (and large) models by merging independent sub-models. Example: When you have models at multiple regions and you'd like to combine them for reporting or planning.Writeback - Post your scenarios, series, comments, etc. to a URL which can be configured to accept an HTTP request and write the data back to your Databases, Sharepoint, Files, etc. Check out the ValQ Pricing page to see the features and the user limits with each plan. tip It is ideal to publish the report to Power BI Service for collaborating with other users. This is because any changes made to ValQ's Model and Plan tabs on Power BI Service would not get updated on the Desktop App. note After a report is published to Power BI Service, republishing the report in the same name would replace the existing file. This means all the changes made to ValQ's Model and Plan tabs on Power BI Service would be erased and the model gets overwritten by the Desktop model version.While on Power BI Service always save the ValQ model and save the Power BI report for other users to see your changes. Also, the report on Power BI needs to be refreshed (URL refresh) to see the changes made by others on ValQ.
