The underlying data used by Simulate tab (referred to by the term ‘base data series’) usually comes from an external source such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database. This base data series cannot be directly modified in the Simulate tab (to maintain the integrity of data). Instead of using the base data series, the Simulate tab allows us to create several scenarios (with each scenario operating on a copy of the base data series). As a result, there is a logical separation between base data series (the original data supplied to the model) vs. scenario data (scenarios created by users).   But what if the base data series itself needs to be updated? In such operations, we leverage the Plan tab where we can create a copy of the base data series, update it and use it as a new reference based on which you can create additional scenarios.
